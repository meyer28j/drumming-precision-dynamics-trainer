# Drumming Precision and Dynamics Trainer

## Summary

The Drumming Precision and Dynamics Trainer provides real-time feedback to the drummer to help them identify any precision errors in timing and dynamics for each drumstroke in a 4-beat pattern. The trainer is a small, 5V electronic device that attaches to a drumming practice pad and visually displays a 4-beat pattern through an LED matrix for a person to follow along with.
